JAX is a deep learning framework that enables training of CPU/GPU/TPU. 

## Implementations of Generative model architectures:
* Generative Adversaraial Networks (GANs) 
    * Vanilla-GAN
    * Deep Convolutional GAN(DC-GAN)
    * Conditional GAN (C-GAN)
    * Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)
    * Progressive GAN (ProGAN)
* Variational Auto-Encoders
    * Auto-Encoder Model architecture
    * 
* Flow-Based Models
* Energy Based Models
* NeuralSDEs (for Continous-Time Generative Models for Time Series Generation)
